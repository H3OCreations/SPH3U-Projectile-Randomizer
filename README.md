# SPH3U-Projectile-Randomizer
The following program generates different numbers for a projectile quiz.  It takes in the classlist from TeachAssist and generates problems of the appropriate category.  The assessment also places the solution in the bottom right corner of the assessment to teach students that their process and breakdown of vectors is more important than the final answer

Developing: Projectile rolled off an edge
Understanding: Ideal Projectile
Mastery: Projectile fired off some height difference

Future features to be developed:
1) Modify the way in which questions are appended into the LaTeX file
2) Adding a variety of questions within each category so that we can get some varience in the types of problems they would be exposed to
3) Integrate csv_writer into the object so we can run from a single main file in future itterations
